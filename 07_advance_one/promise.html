    The promise object represents the eventual completion or (failure) od asynchoronous operation and its resulting value.
    There are three state in promise: 01. Pending 02. Fullfield 03. Rejected

    1. What is a Promise in JavaScript?
            Answer:
            A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its 
            resulting value. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion, avoiding the so-called "callback hell".

            2. How do you create a Promise?
            Answer:
            A Promise can be created using the Promise constructor, which takes a function (executor) that has two arguments: resolve and reject. Here is an example:

            javascript
            Copy code
            const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                // asynchronous operation
                setTimeout(() => {
                    resolve("Success!");
                    // or
                    // reject("Error!");
                }, 1000);
            });
            3. What are the possible states of a Promise?
            Answer:
            A Promise can be in one of three states:

            Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
            Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
            Rejected: The operation failed.
            4. How do you handle the results of a Promise?
            Answer:
            You can handle the results of a Promise using the then and catch methods:

            javascript
            Copy code
            myPromise
                .then(result => {
                    console.log(result); // "Success!"
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    console.error(error); // "Error!"
                });
            5. Explain the difference between Promise.all and Promise.race.
            Answer:

            Promise.all: Takes an array of promises and returns a single Promise that resolves when all the promises in the array have resolved, or rejects if any promise in the array rejects.
            javascript
            Copy code
            Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
                .then(results => {
                    console.log(results); // Array of results
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    console.error(error); // First encountered error
                });
            Promise.race: Takes an array of promises and returns a single Promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the array resolves or rejects.
            javascript
            Copy code
            Promise.race([promise1, promise2, promise3])
                .then(result => {
                    console.log(result); // Result of the first settled promise
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    console.error(error); // Error of the first settled promise
                });
            6. What is the purpose of finally in Promises?
            Answer:
            The finally method is used to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether the Promise is resolved or rejected. This is useful for cleanup actions.

            javascript
            Copy code
            myPromise
                .then(result => {
                    console.log(result);
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    console.error(error);
                })
                .finally(() => {
                    console.log("Cleanup actions");
                });
            7. How can you chain multiple Promises?
            Answer:
            You can chain multiple Promises by returning another Promise in the then method:

            javascript
            Copy code
            myPromise
                .then(result => {
                    console.log(result);
                    return anotherPromise;
                })
                .then(result => {
                    console.log(result);
                    return yetAnotherPromise;
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    console.error(error);
                });
            8. What is async/await, and how does it relate to Promises?
            Answer:
            async and await are syntactic sugar built on top of Promises, allowing you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. An async function returns a Promise, and await pauses the execution of the async function, waiting for the Promise to resolve.

            javascript
            Copy code
            async function myAsyncFunction() {
                try {
                    const result = await myPromise;
                    console.log(result);
                } catch (error) {
                    console.error(error);
                } finally {
                    console.log("Cleanup actions");
                }
            }
            These questions and answers cover key concepts of Promises in JavaScript, providing a solid foundation for discussing asynchronous programming during an interview.
